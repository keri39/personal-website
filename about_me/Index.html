            Hello, my name is Abhishek Keri, and I am currently a student at the
            University of Nebraska at Omaha. I was born in Hyderabad, India and
            completed my undergrad in Civil Engineering getting a first class
            with distinction award. However, I attended a course on design
            thinking and that’s when my perspective changed, and I got more into
            design and web development. Consequently, I was hired after my
            undergrad as a front-end engineer where I got to learn a lot. That
            is when I decided to move up the corporate ladder by getting a
            master’s degree in a more relevant field. Thus, I am currently
            pursuing my master’s in Management Information Systems at UNO.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from my professional interests, I love to dance. But don’t get
            me wrong, I don’t mean professional dance, but more like dancing as
            a hobby. I also love formula 1 and I am huge fan of Charles Leclerc
            (Forza Ferrari!). I would consider myself sociable. The most
            important thing about me is that I am a morning person, I can get
            things done if I wake up early. <br />
            <br />
            I have lived in India for 22 years and this is my first year in the
            United States of America and I hope I have a great time learning and
            exploring!! <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for visiting my page. <br />
            Singing off,
            <br />
